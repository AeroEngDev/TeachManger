# Teach Manager
A program, which helps Teachers to manage the Grades of Students in their Courses. With a nested Pie Chart weights of the grades are
shown and the final grade gets calculated. With the help of grade categories a nested grade structure can be built. E.g Grade 1 is a oral grade, which counts 50 % of the the oral grade, whereas the oral grade counts 60 % of the final grade. Such a structure can easily be built and the final grade can be calculated.
Other functions, like a calender or a encryption of the underlying database will be implemented in the future.

## Installation
To execute the scripts python 3.x is needed. A list of additional packages are lying inside of **requirments**. They can be installed using pip:
> pip install -r requirments

Depending of the pathvariable of the python installation the program can be started using
> python src/main.py

if python points on the local python 3.x installation or
> python3 src/main.py

if python3 points on th local python 3.x installation.
